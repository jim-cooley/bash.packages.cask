# before you image:
scutil --set LocalHostName ""
scutil --set HostName ""
scutil --set ComputerName ""

# clean up logs - do all the periodic tasks
sudo periodic daily weekly monthly

# Once the source is mounted in FW Target mode visit /var/log and /Library/Logs and delete all the *.gz and *.bzg compressed 

# Although the disk image creation step can be eliminated and the NetInstall image created directly from the target machine, I like to create the disk image and make a copy read/write so I can make changes to various files without having to boot the source should the need arise.

# Make sure to disable Spotlight indexing for the FW Target drive once it is mounted on the server.

# also, be sure to to delete machine specific network configuration files from your image:
/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist
/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.network.identification.plist
/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist
